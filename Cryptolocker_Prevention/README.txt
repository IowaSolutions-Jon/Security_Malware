## Cryptoprevention Scheme

1. DC_AD GPOs 

	1. This is the folder containing the GPO images needed to update a controlled 
	environments policies to prevent Cryptolocker or similar infections from running.
	
	2. There are 3 different GPOs in here
		a. Terminal Server
		b. Windows Vista and Above
		c. Windows XP

	3. Once these are applies and the GPUPDATE has been run they should be active.

	4. Noted that occasionally restarting the Server was required to self-apply these
	updates (Windows Server 2008R2 in a VM)   However there is a method for testing - see
	below

	5. To Test open the Utilities Folder and open Cryptoprevent.exe.  There is a Test button
	in the program that should verify if the rules are in place even if it did not apply them
	this test will work.

	6. This can be tested on computers inside the DC_SD as well
	
	7. In the utilities folder there is a bat file ot detect all current .exe files that will
	now be blocked due to the GPO application.    Insure there are added to the exceptions by
	modifying the Cryptoprevention GPO you made with another path to the specific file and 
	set it to Unrestricted Access and it will be able to run regardless of the GPO modification
	that you are making.

2. Non_DC_AD [Automated Scripts]

	1. These scripts will run the Cryptolocker available in the utilities

	2. This applies the same protection for the DC_AD to the end users computer that in itself
	lacks those features.

	3. Also there is whitelisting for any current .exe type files already running in appdata however
	the aggressive version will not add those

	4. Also be warned that restarting is needed to make these rules active on the clients computer.
	There are scripts which will automate this reboot available.

	5. The undo version will remove all rules and again requires a restart

	6. NOTE Always run these files as admin
